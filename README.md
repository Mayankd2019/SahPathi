## Problem behind

- As we all know that all of the classes have moved online due to this pandemic situation and we as a students are facing a really great loss in terms of our studies. And the problem increases when we miss the classes too due to lack of schedule of classes and the notification not being not sent by the online platform like Classroom or Teams.<br>

- Students also face difficulty in terms of the sharing the resources including books,notes and any other document.

## Solution - Our Application "SAHPATHI"

- Student have to register to our application by entering his **email** **password**, **college name** and **branch**.

- Then the student have to login to our app and can see what all classes are there and on what date with the links of the class **links** to the classes.

- Our application has a [backend](https://github.com/tushar912/Hack-CBS) running on firebase that has the timetable to classes for each branch of that college and using FCM we send notification 5 min's before the start of the class(with the link to class) and 5 min's before the end of that class to alert the user.

- Our application also has a feature of of sharing the resources for our class and to the whole of his branch so that his classmate can get those resources easily at one place and not cluttered at diffrent places.For sharing resources we have made [backend](https://github.com/loneWarrior581/hackCBS-api) using node js being deployed on [heroku](https://hackcbs.herokuapp.com/).
